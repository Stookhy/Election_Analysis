## Overview of Election Audit:

1.	Create and navigate folders path

3.	Run python file in Visual Studio Codes
4.	Perform mathematical calculations 
5.	Using lists, tuples, and dictionaries to access data structures 
6.	Create and use decision and repetition statements 
7.	Create and use membership and logical operators to create compound comparison expressions or conditional statements for data retrieval
8.	Use printing formats to add printing statements in script

## Election-Audit Summary: 

  The script can be used for any election, with some modifications to the script. For instance, the analysis can be more detailed by providing a percentage view of votes for each candidate, for each county. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to the code. Also, this can be expanded and has the capacity to include more candidates and counties, simply by modifying the script to expand the data source.
